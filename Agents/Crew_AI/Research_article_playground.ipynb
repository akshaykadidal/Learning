Here are the important papers and a summary of what each one says:\\n\\n1. **A Framework For Intelligent Multi-Agent System Based Neural Networks**:\\n   - **Summary**: This paper discusses the structure of multi-agent systems (MAS) and their components. It highlights the potential of intelligent multi-agent systems in various research areas, especially in virtual environments to support machine learning models. The paper proposes a new Supervised Multi-layers Feed Forward Neural Network (SMFFNN) model as the core of an intelligent agent-based learning framework to address the lack of a unified framework for combining intelligent multi-agent technology and learning in real environments.\\n\\n2. **A Survey on Context-Aware Multi-Agent Systems**:\\n   - **Summary**: This survey paper delves into multi-agent systems (MAS) that comprise multiple autonomous agents interacting with each other and their environment to achieve goals. It emphasizes the importance of context awareness in MAS for dealing with dynamic situations. The survey provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art context-aware multi-agent systems, addressing the gap in existing research on integrating context-aware systems with multi-agent systems.\\n\\n3. **The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents**:\\n   - **Summary**: This comprehensive survey on LLM-based agents traces the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI. It explores the extensive applications of LLM-based agents in single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and human-agent cooperation. The paper discusses the challenges of quantifying and objectively evaluating LLM-based agents and highlights potential risks such as exacerbation of unemployment and misuse of LLMs.\\n\\n4. **Agent AI: Surveying the Horizons of Multimodal Interaction**:\\n   - **Summary**: This paper defines \\\"Agent AI\\\" as a class of interactive systems that can perceive visual stimuli, language inputs, and other environmentally-grounded data to produce meaningful embodied actions. It explores systems aiming to improve agents based on next-embodied action prediction. The paper presents a general overview of an Agent AI system that can perceive and act in many different domains and applications, potentially serving as a route towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) using an agent paradigm.\\n\\n5. **Practices for Governing Agentic AI Systems** (OpenAI White Paper):\\n   - **Summary**: This white paper suggests a definition of agentic AI systems and the parties in the agentic AI system life-cycle. It highlights the importance of agreeing on a set of baseline responsibilities and safety best practices for each of these parties. The paper emphasizes that agentic AI systems, which can adaptably achieve complex goals in complex environments with limited direct supervision, have substantial potential to help people more efficiently and effectively achieve their own goals but also create risks of harm. It discusses the need to mitigate these failures, vulnerabilities, and abuses to achieve the full benefits of agentic AI systems.\\n\\nThese papers collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of the concept of Agentic AI, its architecture, and its potential applications, as well as the challenges and considerations involved in its development and deployment.\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}}]}\n"

       "'Several papers have contributed significantly to the concept of Agentic AI, each highlighting different aspects and dimensions of this emerging field. Here are the important papers and a summary of what each one says:\\n\\n1. **A Framework For Intelligent Multi-Agent System Based Neural Networks**:\\n   - **Summary**: This paper discusses the structure of multi-agent systems (MAS) and their components. It highlights the potential of intelligent multi-agent systems in various research areas, especially in virtual environments to support machine learning models. The paper proposes a new Supervised Multi-layers Feed Forward Neural Network (SMFFNN) model as the core of an intelligent agent-based learning framework to address the lack of a unified framework for combining intelligent multi-agent technology and learning in real environments.\\n\\n2. **A Survey on Context-Aware Multi-Agent Systems**:\\n   - **Summary**: This survey paper delves into multi-agent systems (MAS) that comprise multiple autonomous agents interacting with each other and their environment to achieve goals. It emphasizes the importance of context awareness in MAS for dealing with dynamic situations. The survey provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art context-aware multi-agent systems, addressing the gap in existing research on integrating context-aware systems with multi-agent systems.\\n\\n3. **The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents**:\\n   - **Summary**: This comprehensive survey on LLM-based agents traces the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI. It explores the extensive applications of LLM-based agents in single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and human-agent cooperation. The paper discusses the challenges of quantifying and objectively evaluating LLM-based agents and highlights potential risks such as exacerbation of unemployment and misuse of LLMs.\\n\\n4. **Agent AI: Surveying the Horizons of Multimodal Interaction**:\\n   - **Summary**: This paper defines \"Agent AI\" as a class of interactive systems that can perceive visual stimuli, language inputs, and other environmentally-grounded data to produce meaningful embodied actions. It explores systems aiming to improve agents based on next-embodied action prediction. The paper presents a general overview of an Agent AI system that can perceive and act in many different domains and applications, potentially serving as a route towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) using an agent paradigm.\\n\\n5. **Practices for Governing Agentic AI Systems** (OpenAI White Paper):\\n   - **Summary**: This white paper suggests a definition of agentic AI systems and the parties in the agentic AI system life-cycle. It highlights the importance of agreeing on a set of baseline responsibilities and safety best practices for each of these parties. The paper emphasizes that agentic AI systems, which can adaptably achieve complex goals in complex environments with limited direct supervision, have substantial potential to help people more efficiently and effectively achieve their own goals but also create risks of harm. It discusses the need to mitigate these failures, vulnerabilities, and abuses to achieve the full benefits of agentic AI systems.\\n\\nThese papers collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of the concept of Agentic AI, its architecture, and its potential applications, as well as the challenges and considerations involved in its development and deployment.'"

      "\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly bridged the gap between machines and human intelligence, reaching remarkable heights in comprehending and generating human-like text. At the core of this revolution lies the emergence of AI agents powered by memory and Large Language Models (LLMs). This article delves into how these advanced AI agents outperform standalone LLMs by reducing hallucinations and enhancing output quality, thereby promising a future where AI can understand, learn from, and interact with the world in much the same way as humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large language models, such as GPT-3, have been the talk of the town for their ability to generate human-like text. However, when complemented with memory, these models evolve into AI agents capable of long-term and complex agent-environment interactions, which significantly enhances their performance. Memory allows AI agents to retain and reference information during interactions, leading to coherent dialogues and reliable multi-step actions. As a result, they excel in executing interconnected, long-sequence tasks with minimal errors and inefficiencies[1].\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of AI, hallucination is a prevalent challenge where AI models generate incorrect or irrelevant information. However, the integration of memory in AI agents offers a promising solution. Memory aids AI agents in recalling past experiences, the context of the text, relevant facts, and syntax of programming languages, thus reducing hallucination. Techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), ReAct prompting, and Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) prompting further mitigate hallucination[2][3][4].\n",
